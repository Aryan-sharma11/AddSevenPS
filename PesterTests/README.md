# README


To test the `AddSeven` module within the Powershell layer we use the [Pester](https://pester-docs.netlify.app/) framework.

To execute these tests 

- Make sure that `Pester` is [installed](https://pester-docs.netlify.app/docs/introduction/installation) 
- Then execute the `Run-Pester.ps1` script within the `PesterTests` folder


```powershell
# From inside the PesterTests folder
./Run-Pester.ps1
```


## Resources

Relevant assertions for testing can be found in [this reference page](https://pester-docs.netlify.app/docs/assertions/assertions).
